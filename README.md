# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

One thing I would want to improve on the webpage is. I would make it more visually impaired for users that have a hard time with vision. Adding a magnifying cursor as the user would hover over text or images would be helpful to the user.
